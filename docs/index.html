    <p>
      The Global Open Data Index provides insights into the open availability of the government data of most countries.
      The map displays the countries that are included in the Global Open Data Index. A next iteration of the map will
      include the range of scores that countries have been assigned. Scores for countries open data status are based on
      a few factors. In order for a country to have a higher score, it needs to meet the minimum requirement of having
      three characteristics out of six.
    </p>
    <p>
      To meet all six characteristics, the government data needs to be open licensed and publicly available, as well as,
      in an open and machine-readable format. Additionally, the open data must be up to date and downloadable all at
      once. Finally, the data needs to be totally free of charge. The purpose of the evaluation of each country public
      open database is to decide which countries have their information open for general public knowledge.
